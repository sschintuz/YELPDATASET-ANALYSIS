This project involves profiling, understanding, and analyzing the Yelp dataset. The dataset contains information about businesses, users, reviews, check-ins, and more. The analysis is divided into two parts:

Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

In this part, various aspects of the dataset are explored and analyzed using SQL queries. The analysis includes:

Total number of records for each table
Total distinct records by primary key or foreign key for each table
Checking for null values in the Users table
Finding the minimum, maximum, and average values for specific columns
Listing cities with the most reviews
Distribution of star ratings for businesses in specified cities
Finding the top users based on their total number of reviews
Exploring the correlation between the number of reviews and the number of fans
Identifying if there are more reviews with the word "love" or "hate" in them

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

This part involves drawing inferences and performing analysis based on specific questions and scenarios. For example:
Comparing businesses with 2-3 stars to those with 4-5 stars in a particular city and category
Grouping businesses based on whether they are open or closed and identifying differences between them
